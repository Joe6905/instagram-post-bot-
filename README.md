# Instagram Photo Upload Bot

This script demonstrates how to upload a photo to Instagram using the `instagrapi` Python package. The bot logs in, uploads a photo with a caption, and logs out.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `instagrapi` package

You can install the `instagrapi` library by running:

```bash
pip install instagrapi
Getting Started
Clone or download this repository: If this is a new project, you can create a new directory and download the script to your local machine.

Set up login details: Edit the script to add your Instagram username and password.

Script Usage: You can use the following code in your Python file to upload a photo to Instagram.

from instagrapi import Client

# Login details
USERNAME = 'usrnme'
PASSWORD = 'passwd'

# Initialize the Client
bot = Client()

# Login to Instagram
bot.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)

# Path to the photo
photo_path = "C:\\Users\\Downloads\\img"

# Caption for the post
caption = "caption"

# Upload the photo
bot.photo_upload(photo_path, caption)

# Logout after posting
bot.logout()
```
Steps
Install instagrapi: Run the following command in your terminal to install the required library:


pip install instagrapi
Login to Instagram: Use the provided username and password to authenticate the bot:


bot.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
Upload a photo: Provide the file path to the image you want to upload and specify the caption for your post:


bot.photo_upload(photo_path, caption)
Logout: After successfully uploading the photo, the bot will log out from your Instagram account:


bot.logout()


Notes
Make sure to provide the correct path for the image and verify that the file exists before uploading.
Handle your login credentials securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the script directly.
Troubleshooting
Ensure that your Instagram account is not protected by 2FA (two-factor authentication), or add logic to handle it if necessary.
If you face any issues with login or uploading, check the official instagrapi documentation for more details.
